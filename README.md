A more up-to-date version of this project exists here: https://github.com/mymikemiller/abrasion-hologram-printer/

Assists in creating 3d scratch holograms (aka abrasion holograms or chatoyant holograms). They can be created on acrylic or metal sheets using only an adjustable compass as described on Bill Beaty's website: http://www.amasci.com/holo/
